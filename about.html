    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>The Berry College Trails project was created to share information about the beautiful and extensive trail system at Berry College. Our goal is to promote outdoor recreation, sustainability, and stewardship of Berry’s natural lands.</p>

    <p>This website is student-built and community-supported. We aim to make it easier for hikers, students, and visitors to explore the campus responsibly while learning about Berry’s environmental efforts.</p>

    <h2>Contact & Collaboration</h2>
